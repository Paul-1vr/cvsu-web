        <h1 class="rules">GENERAL ACADEMIC RULES AND REGULATIONS</h1>
        <p class="regs"><b>1. </b>Admission Requirements - To be admitted to Cavite State University, students must pass the entrance examination, submit the necessary documents (such as high school records and medical certificates), and meet the program-specific requirements. Admission to certain programs may require additional steps, such as an interview or a special examination.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>2. </b>Grading System - CvSU uses a grading system that ranges from 1.00 (Excellent) to 5.00 (Fail). To maintain good academic standing, students are required to have a Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.00. A grade of 3.00 is considered passing, while a grade of 5.00 indicates failure. Incomplete grades (INC) are given if students fail to complete course requirements on time but can still make up for the deficiencies within a prescribed period.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>3. </b>Attendance - Students are required to attend at least 80% of their classes for each subject. Excessive absences, usually exceeding 20% of the total class hours, may lead to a failing grade in the course. In case of legitimate absences due to illness or emergencies, students must submit an official excuse letter with supporting documentation.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>4. </b>Academic loads - Full-time students must enroll in 18 to 21 units per semester, while part-time students may take fewer units based on individual circumtancess. Any change in academic load requires approval from academic advisers.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>5. </b>Academic Probation - Students whose GPA falls below 2.00 are placed on academic probation. During the probation period, they must improve their academic performance within the next semester. Failure to raise their GPA after the probation period may result in academic disqualification, preventing them from continuing their studies at CvSU.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>6. </b>Academic Integrity - Academic dishonesty, such as cheating and plagiarism, is prohibited at CvSU. Violators may face disciplinary actions, including failing the course, suspension, or expulsion, depending on the severity of the offense.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>7. </b>Promotion & Graduating - Students must complete all required courses within the designated timeframe and maintain the required GPA to be promoted. To graduate, they need to meet all academic requirements, such as passing exams, projects, or a thesis, and graduate within the program's duration.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>8. </b>Graduation with Honors - Students who wish to graduate with honors, such as Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, or Summa Cum Laude, must meet specific academic criteria, including maintaining a high GPA and fulfilling all program requirements within the prescribed timeframe for their degree.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>9. </b>Disciplinary Actions - As a student of Cvsu, must follow CvSU's code of conduct, maintaining proper behavior both in and out of the classroom. Violations like misconduct, substance abuse, or bullying may lead to disciplinary actions, from warnings to suspension or expulsion, depending on the severity.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>10. </b>Transfer Policies - Transfer students must meet CvSU's admission criteria, including submitting transcripts and undergoing a credit evaluation. The university will determine which credits from the previous institution can be applied to the student's degree program.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>11. </b>Student Responsibilities - Students are responsible for managing their academic progress by attending classes, completing assignments on time, following university policies, and seeking help from professors or advisers when needed.</p>
        <p class="regs"><b>12. </b>SPECIAL PROGRAM - CvSU offers special programs such as scholarships and financial aid to support students financially.
